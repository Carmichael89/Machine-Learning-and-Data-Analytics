    "\n",
    "The core gym interface is ``env``, which is the unified environment interface. The following list shows the basic ``env`` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``env.reset()``: Resets the environment and returns a random initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ``env.step(action)``: Step the environment by one timestep. Returns\n",
    "\n",
    " - observation (object): This is the current state of the environment and is an environment-specific object representing your observation of the environment. For example, pixel data from a camera, joint angles and joint velocities of a robot, or the board state in a board game.\n",
    "\n",
    " - reward (float): amount of reward achieved by the previous action. The scale varies between environments, but the goal is always to increase your total reward.\n",
    "\n",
    " - done (boolean): whether it’s time to reset the environment again. Most (but not all) tasks are divided up into well-defined episodes, and done being True indicates the episode has terminated. (For example, perhaps the pole tipped too far, or you lost your last life.)\n",
    "\n",
    " - info (dict): diagnostic information useful for debugging. It can sometimes be useful for learning (for example, it might contain the raw probabilities behind the environment’s last state change). However, official evaluations of your agent are not allowed to use this for learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ``env.render()``: Renders one frame of the environment (helpful in visualizing the environment)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We can best illustrate these notions with an example such as the Taxi-v3 environment. \n",

    "# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is learning what to do; how to map situations to actions as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner, or agent, is not told which actions to take, but to instead discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. This type of model can be thought of a specific instance of Markov decision processes (MDP's). The learner and action maker is called the **agent**. The thing that the agent interacts with is called the **environment**, which can be thought of as everything outside the agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent and environment interact in a looping process, where the agent observes some portion of the environment and takes an action, after which, the environment responds and presents a new situation to the agent. More specifically, the agent and environment  interact at each of a sequence of discrete time steps $t = 0, 1, \\dots, T$, where $T$ is the **terminal state**. At each time step $t$, the agent recieves some representation of the environment's **state**, $S_t \\in \\mathcal{S}$, and on that basis selects an **action**, $A_t \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Here, $\\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all possible states and $\\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all possible/valid actions. One time step later, and in part as a consequence of action $A_t$, the agents recieves a numerical **reward**, $R_{t+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and finds itself in a new state, $S_{t+1}\\in \\mathcal{S}$. The MDP and agent together give rise to a sequence, or **trajectory** typically denoted by $\\tau$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau = S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, S_2, A_2, R_3, \\dots \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the agent is to maximize its rewards over a given trajectory starting from state $S_t$. This is called the **return** and is given with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_{t} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^{2} R_{t+3} \\dots, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$ is the **discount rate**. The discount rate determines the present value of the future rewards. This formula can be written recursively as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_{t} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1}. \n",
